# Roadmap
## 2025[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/roadmap/#2025 "Direct link to 2025")
### Flet 1.0[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/roadmap/#flet-10 "Direct link to Flet 1.0")
  * **Long-term maintainability:** Controls are implemented using Python **dataclasses** , while the Flutter client adopts the built-in state management approach, eliminating the need for Redux. Ensures symmetric data structures in Python and Dart.
  * **Enhanced Developer Experience (DX):** Control documentation is generated directly from source code, preventing discrepancies between docs, comments, and examples. Provides accurate IDE assistance.
  * **Optimized Communication:** A binary protocol between Python and Dart eliminates unnecessary base64-to-bytes conversions, reducing CPU overhead and improving memory efficiency.


Flet 0.90 will be released as a preparatory step for Flet 1.0, introducing major changes, including breaking updates.
### Website[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/roadmap/#website "Direct link to Website")
