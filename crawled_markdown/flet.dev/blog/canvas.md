Unleash your inner artist üßë‚Äçüé® and boost your Flet creativity with brand-new [Canvas](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/canvas) control just released in [Flet 0.6.0](https://pypi.org/project/flet/)!
Canvas enables you to draw arbitrary graphics using a set of primitives, or "shapes", such as line, circle, arc, path and text. I bet you can even implement your own version of [charts](https://flet.dev/blog/flet-charts) using Canvas control!
Combine Canvas with [GestureDetector](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/gesturedetector) and you get a free-hand drawing app - Flet Brush üòÄ!
![](https://flet.dev/img/docs/controls/canvas/canvas-flet-brush.gif)
[Example source](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/controls/canvas/canvas-flet-brush.py)
`Canvas` control is located in `flet.canvas` package. You need another import to use it:
```
import flet.canvas as cv
```

Here's a simple program drawing a smiley face with [`Circle`](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/canvas#circle-shape-properties) and [`Arc`](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/canvas#arc-shape-properties) shapes using filled and stroke [`Paint`](https://flet.dev/docs/reference/types/paint):
```
import mathimport flet as ftimport flet.canvas as cvdefmain(page: ft.Page):  stroke_paint = paint = ft.Paint(stroke_width=2, style=ft.PaintingStyle.STROKE)  fill_paint = paint = ft.Paint(style=ft.PaintingStyle.FILL)  cp = cv.Canvas([      cv.Circle(100,100,50, stroke_paint),      cv.Circle(80,90,10, stroke_paint),      cv.Circle(84,87,5, fill_paint),      cv.Circle(120,90,10, stroke_paint),      cv.Circle(124,87,5, fill_paint),      cv.Arc(70,95,60,40,0, math.pi, paint=stroke_paint),],    width=float("inf"),    expand=True,)  page.add(cp)ft.app(main)
```

## Other changes[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/canvas/#other-changes "Direct link to Other changes")
### Rich text support[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/canvas/#rich-text-support "Direct link to Rich text support")
While working on [drawing text on Canvas](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/canvas#drawing-text), as a bonus to this release, we implemented a new [`TextSpan`](https://flet.dev/docs/reference/types/textspan) control which can now be used with [`Text.spans`](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/text#spans) to output rich text.
![](https://flet.dev/img/docs/controls/text/richtext-borders-stroke.png)
Check rich text examples: [one](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/text#rich-text-basics), [two](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/text#rich-text-with-borders-and-stroke) and [three](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/text#rich-text-with-gradient).
### `url` property for buttons[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/canvas/#url-property-for-buttons "Direct link to url-property-for-buttons")
If you need to open a URL by clicking on a button or any other control with `on_click` event you can just provide that URL in `url` instead of doing that in the code with [`page.launch_url()`](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/page#launch_urlurl) method.
Instead of that:
```
ft.ElevatedButton("Go to Google", on_click=lambda e: e.page.launch_url("https://google.com"))
```

you can just do this:
```
ft.ElevatedButton("Go to Google", url="https://google.com")
```

A new `url` property also solves [blocked window on Safari](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/issues/1105) issue.
### Auto-follow links in `Markdown`[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/canvas/#auto-follow-links-in-markdown "Direct link to auto-follow-links-in-markdown")
As a continuation of `url` property `Markdown` control can now be enabled to auto-follow URLs in the document:
```
import flet as ftmd ="""[Go to Google](https://www.google.com)"""defmain(page: ft.Page):  page.add(    ft.Markdown(      md,      extension_set=ft.MarkdownExtensionSet.GITHUB_WEB,      auto_follow_links=True,))ft.app(main)
```

### Better web support[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/canvas/#better-web-support "Direct link to Better web support")
In this release we also did some improvements to web support like [capturing user info in `page.client_id` and `page.client_user_agent`](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/1302) as well as fixing nasty [#1333](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/1333) and [#1289](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/1289) bugs related to routing.
That's all for today!
Upgrade Flet module to the latest version (`pip install flet --upgrade`), give canvas and rich text a try and [let us know](https://discord.gg/dzWXP8SHG8) what you think!
