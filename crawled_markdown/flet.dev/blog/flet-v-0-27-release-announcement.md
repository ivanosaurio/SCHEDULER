# Flet v0.27.0 Release Announcement
February 20, 2025 ¬∑ 5 min read

Flet 0.27.0 is now released with exciting new features and improvements!
  * **iOS packaging & signing updates** ‚Äì ensures compliance with App Store Connect verification requirements.
  * **Reduced startup delay** ‚Äì faster initial launch for desktop applications.
  * **Faster incremental re-builds** ‚Äì enhances development efficiency with quicker iteration times.
  * **Enhanced Dropdown control** ‚Äì improved functionality and user experience.
  * **Bug fixes & stability improvements** ‚Äì various fixes to enhance overall performance and reliability.


## How to upgrade[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/flet-v-0-27-release-announcement/#how-to-upgrade "Direct link to How to upgrade")
Run the following command to upgrade Flet:
```
pip install 'flet[all]' --upgrade
```

note
`[all]` is an "extra" specifier which tells pip to install or upgrade all `flet` packages: `flet`, `flet-cli`, `flet-desktop` and `flet-web`.
Bump `flet` package version to `0.27.0` (or remove it at all to use the latest) in your `pyproject.toml`.
## Revamped iOS Packaging[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/flet-v-0-27-release-announcement/#revamped-ios-packaging "Direct link to Revamped iOS Packaging")
  * Third-party Flet app dependencies (also known as ‚Äúsite packages‚Äù like `numpy`, `pandas`, `flet`, etc.) are now bundled inside a framework, ensuring Xcode signs all files correctly and passes App Store Connect verification.
  * New `flet build` options for proper iOS package signing.
  * Comprehensive step-by-step documentation for packaging and deploying iOS apps. [Learn more!](https://flet.dev/docs/publish/ios)


## Enhanced startup performance for desktop apps[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/flet-v-0-27-release-announcement/#enhanced-startup-performance-for-desktop-apps "Direct link to Enhanced startup performance for desktop apps")
Currently, when packaging for macOS, Windows, and Linux, third-party Flet app dependencies (e.g., numpy, pandas, flet, etc.), also known as **site packages** , are bundled inside the app.zip artifact. This can cause a startup delay, sometimes significant, as the app needs to extract the artifact to the user‚Äôs file system before launching.
With Flet 0.27.0, site packages are now copied in an **unpacked state** directly into the application bundle instead of being compressed into app.zip. This change significantly reduces the first launch time.
## Faster incremental re-builds[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/flet-v-0-27-release-announcement/#faster-incremental-re-builds "Direct link to Faster incremental re-builds")
If certain parts of the build configuration remain unchanged, the `flet build` command attempts to skip or optimize specific build pipeline steps (such as re-installing Flet app dependencies), reducing the overall completion time for consecutive builds.
Faster builds mean happier developers! üòÑ
## Pyodide 0.27.2[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/flet-v-0-27-release-announcement/#pyodide-0272 "Direct link to Pyodide 0.27.2")
Pyodide 0.27.2 is based on Python 3.12 and has some serious performance improvments to foreign function interface (FFI).
Flet now supports Python 3.12 across all packaging platforms.
The next stop is Python 3.13!
## Enhanced `Dropdown` control.[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/flet-v-0-27-release-announcement/#enhanced-dropdown-control "Direct link to enhanced-dropdown-control")
Since version 0.27.0, Flet uses [DropdownMenu](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/DropdownMenu-class.html) flutter widget for [Dropdown](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/dropdown) control, which is a Material 3 version of previously used DropdownButton. Additionally to enhanced look and feel, it allows filter the list based on the text input or search one item in the menu list.
![](https://flet.dev/img/docs/controls/dropdown/dropdown-search.gif)
Some properties of previous Dropdown implementation are not available in the new version and were "stubbed" - they will not break your program but don't do anything. See the list of deprecated properties [here](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/dropdown/#deprecated-dropdown-properties-and-events).
Previous version of Dropdown control is available as [`DropdownM2`](https://flet.dev/docs/controls/dropdownm2) control and will be removed in Flet 0.30.0.
## üí• Breaking changes[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/flet-v-0-27-release-announcement/#-breaking-changes "Direct link to üí• Breaking changes")
