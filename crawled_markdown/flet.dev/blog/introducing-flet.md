# Introducing Flet

Today we announce the first release of Flet!
Flet is a framework for building real-time web, desktop and mobile applications in Python.
No more complex architecture with JavaScript frontend, REST API backend, database, cache, etc. With Flet you just write a monolith stateful app in Python only and get multi-user, realtime Single-Page Application (SPA) or a mobile app.
To start developing with Flet, you just need your favorite IDE or text editor. No SDKs, no thousands of dependencies, no complex tooling - Flet has built-in web server with assets hosting and desktop clients.
Flet UI is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), so your app looks professional and can be delivered to any platform. Flet simplifies Flutter model by combining smaller "widgets" into ready-to-use "controls" with imperative programming model. You get all the power of Flutter without having to learn Dart!
Flet app is deployed as a regular web app and can be instanly accessed with a browser or installed as a [PWA](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) on a mobile device. Web app also exposes an API that can be used by a Flet client (planned for [future releases](https://flet.dev/roadmap)) running on iOS and Android and providing native mobile experience.
Some examples:
  * [Greeter](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/greeter/greeter.py)
  * [Counter](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/counter/counter.py)
  * [To-Do](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/todo/todo.py)
  * [Icons Browser](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/icons-browser/main.py) ([Online Demo](https://gallery.flet.dev/icons-browser/))
