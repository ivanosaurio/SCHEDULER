# Introducing Flet 1.0 Alpha
June 26, 2025 ¬∑ 12 min read
[![Feodor Fitsner](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5041459?s=400&v=4)](ttps://github.com/FeodorFitsner)
[Feodor Fitsner](ttps://github.com/FeodorFitsner)
Flet founder and developer
[](https://github.com/FeodorFitsner "GitHub")[](https://x.com/fletdev "X")
Flet has been in the making for over three years, steadily gaining traction and building a vibrant user community. As more developers adopt Flet for real-world projects, one thing has become clear: people are ready to commit ‚Äî but they also want to see the same commitment from us.
Releasing **Flet 1.0** isn‚Äôt just about a version number. It‚Äôs about signaling stability, maturity, and long-term vision. A stable API, comprehensive documentation, better testing and clearly communicated roadmap ‚Äî these are the foundational pieces developers need to confidently build serious apps on Flet.
But **Flet 1.0 isn‚Äôt just the next incremental release. It‚Äôs a complete re-architecture**.
The first versions of Flet inherited design decisions from Pglet ‚Äî a web-based framework with a focus on multi-language support. While that served as a useful starting point, Flet has since evolved into a Python-centric framework for building cross-platform apps ‚Äî web, desktop, and mobile.
With that evolution came technical debt, architectural misfits, and increasing complexity. Rather than patch over the cracks, we made a bold decision: to rewrite Flet from the ground up. It‚Äôs always risky to rewrite, but there‚Äôs no better time than now ‚Äî before 1.0 ‚Äî while the user base is still manageable and we can afford to break things in the name of long-term simplicity and maintainability.
After nearly five months of work, **today we‚Äôre releasing the Flet 1.0 Alpha ‚Äî a technical preview of what‚Äôs coming.**
## What‚Äôs new[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#whats-new "Direct link to What‚Äôs new")
Flet 1.0 introduces major changes that simplify how you build, run, and scale apps. Some are improvements, some are breaking ‚Äî all are focused on giving you a faster, more flexible developer experience.
  * **Declarative approach to building Flet apps** - alongside the traditional imperative style.
  * **Auto-update** - automatic page updates after event handler completion.
  * **Services** - persistent, non-UI components that live across UI rebuilds and navigation. Existing controls such as `Audio`, `FilePicker`, `Clipboard` were re-written as services.
  * **Complete WASM (WebAssembly) support for web apps** - faster download and performance on modern browsers.
  * **Offline (no-CDN) mode for web apps** - Flutter resources and Pyodide are bundled with the app.
  * **Embedding Flet apps into existing web page** - render Flet app into an HTML element on any web page.
  * **Enhanced Extensions API** - to export services along with controls, with a room for future customizations like splash and loading screens.


### Declarative approach[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#declarative-approach "Direct link to Declarative approach")
Flet 1.0 introduces a **declarative/reactive approach** to building UIs in Flet. Developers can now mix **imperative** and **declarative** patterns in the same app, enabling more flexible and functional UI code.
#### Basic declarative Flet app example[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#basic-declarative-flet-app-example "Direct link to Basic declarative Flet app example")
```
from dataclasses import dataclassimport flet as ft@dataclassclassAppState:  count:intdefincrement(self):    self.count +=1defmain(page: ft.Page):  state = AppState(count=0)  page.floating_action_button = ft.FloatingActionButton(    icon=ft.Icons.ADD, on_click=state.increment)  page.add(    ft.ControlBuilder(      state,lambda state: ft.SafeArea(        ft.Container(          ft.Text(value=f"{state.count}", size=50),          alignment=ft.Alignment.center(),),        expand=True,),      expand=True,))ft.run(main)
```

More declarative examples:
  * [Edit form](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/v1/python/apps/declarative/edit-form.py)
  * [Progress bar with yield](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/v1/python/apps/declarative/progress-with-yield.py)
  * üöÄ [Reactive ToDo app](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/v1/python/apps/todo/todo-reactive.py)


üöß Documentation is in progress üöß
### Auto-update[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#auto-update "Direct link to Auto-update")
`Control.update()` is now automatically called once its event handler method is finished. Most of Flet apps will now work without explicit `update()` calls.
Use `yield` inside long-running event handlers to refresh UI, for example:
```
asyncdefbutton_click(): progress.value ="Something started"yieldawait asyncio.sleep(3) progress.value ="Something finished"
```

üöß Documentation is in progress üöß
### Services[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#services "Direct link to Services")
"Service" is a persistent, non-visual control that can "survive" page updates and navigation transitions.
Some of the existing controls were re-implemented as services (breaking change):
  * `Audio` ([extension](https://pypi.org/project/flet-audio/))
  * `AudioRecorder` ([extension](https://pypi.org/project/flet-audio-recorder/))
  * `FilePicker`
  * `Flashlight` ([extension](https://pypi.org/project/flet-flashlight/))
  * `Geolocator` ([extension](https://pypi.org/project/flet-geolocator/))
  * `HapticFeedback`
  * `InterstitialAd` ([extension](https://pypi.org/project/flet-ads/))
  * `PermissionHandler` ([extension](https://pypi.org/project/flet-permission-handler/))
  * `SemanticsService`
  * `ShakeDetector`


Service instances must be added to `page.services` list to work.
### WebAssembly support[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#webassembly-support "Direct link to WebAssembly support")
Flet 1.0 web apps use WebAssembly (WASM) by default on [selected browsers](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/wasm#learn-more-about-browser-compatibility).
Built-in Flet web client and Flet apps built with `flet build web` are now include both Dart2JS (with CanvasKit as a renderer) and WebAssembly (with SKWASM renderer) targets.
üöß Documentation is in progress üöß
### Offline mode for web apps[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#offline-mode-for-web-apps "Direct link to Offline mode for web apps")
Flet 1.0 has "no-CDN" mode which allows bundling the following resources along with your app instead of loading them from external CDNs:
  * CanvasKit
  * SkWASM
  * Pyodide
  * Fonts


To enable no-CDN during runtime either add `no_cdn=True` to `ft.run()` (it's a new `ft.app()`) call:
```
ft.run(main, no_cdn=True)
```

or set `FLET_WEB_NO_CDN` environment variable to `1`, `true` or `yes`.
To enable no-CDN for `flet build` add `--no-cdn` argument.
üöß Documentation is in progress üöß
### Embedding Flet web apps[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#embedding-flet-web-apps "Direct link to Embedding Flet web apps")
You can now embed a Flet web app into any HTML element within an existing web page.
It's also possible to render multiple views of the same app in different HTML elements.
üöß Documentation is in progress üöß
### Enhanced Extensions API[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#enhanced-extensions-api "Direct link to Enhanced Extensions API")
The new extensions API allows exporting from your Flutter package of both control and service widgets. Technically, an extension is a class now rather than a method which will allow us to add more hooks into it like custom spash and loading screens.
For example, `flet-ads` extension before has just one `createControl` method:
create_control.dart
```
import 'package:flet/flet.dart';import 'package:google_mobile_ads/google_mobile_ads.dart';import 'banner.dart';import 'interstitial.dart';CreateControlFactory createControl = (CreateControlArgs args) { switch (args.control.type) {  case "banner_ad":   return BannerAdControl(     parent: args.parent, control: args.control, backend: args.backend);  case "interstitial_ad":   return InterstitialAdControl(     parent: args.parent, control: args.control, backend: args.backend);  default:   return null; }};void ensureInitialized() { if (isMobilePlatform()) {  MobileAds.instance.initialize(); }}
```

and for Flet v1 it has two methods `createWidget` and `createService`:
extension.dart
```
import 'package:flet/flet.dart';import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';import 'package:google_mobile_ads/google_mobile_ads.dart';import 'banner.dart';import 'interstitial.dart';class Extension extends FletExtension { @override void ensureInitialized() {  if (isMobilePlatform()) {   MobileAds.instance.initialize();  } } @override FletService? createService(Control control) {  switch (control.type) {   case "InterstitialAd":    return InterstitialAdService(control: control);   default:    return null;  } } @override Widget? createWidget(Key? key, Control control) {  switch (control.type) {   case "BannerAd":    return BannerAdControl(control: control);   default:    return null;  } }}
```

This change is breaking.
üöß Documentation is in progress üöß
### Other changes and improvements[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#other-changes-and-improvements "Direct link to Other changes and improvements")
### `ft.run` with `before_main`[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#ftrun-with-before_main "Direct link to ftrun-with-before_main")
A new `before_main` arg added to `ft.run()` (replaces `ft.app()`). `before_main` is a hook that allows to reliable configure page-level event handlers before Flutter client starts sending events. `before_main` is a function that accepts one parameter: `page: ft.Page`
Example usage:
```
defconfig(page: ft.Page): page.on_resize =lambda e:print("Page resized!")defmain(page: ft.Page): page.add(ft.Text("Hello!"))ft.run(main, before_main=config)
```

#### Storage paths[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#storage-paths "Direct link to Storage paths")
There is a new `page.storage_paths` multi-platform API based on [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) for finding commonly used locations on the filesystem:
```
get_application_cache_directory_async(self)->strget_application_documents_directory_async(self)->strget_application_support_directory_async(self)->strget_downloads_directory_async(self)-> Optional[str]get_external_cache_directories_async(self)-> Optional[List[str]]get_external_storage_directories_async(self)-> Optional[List[str]]get_library_directory_async(self)->strget_external_cache_directory_async(self)-> Optional[str]get_temporary_directory_async(self)->strget_console_log_filename_async(self)->str
```

üöß Documentation is in progress üöß
#### Event handlers without `e`[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#event-handlers-without-e "Direct link to event-handlers-without-e")
Event handlers can now omit `e` parameter, for example both of these work:
```
button_1.on_click =lambda:print("Clicked!")button_2.on_click =lambda e:print("Clicked!", e)
```

or
```
defincrement():print("Increment clicked")inc_btn.on_click = increment
```

#### `Control.before_event(e)` hook[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#controlbefore_evente-hook "Direct link to controlbefore_evente-hook")
The method is called before calling any event handler.
It receives an instance of `ControlEvent` as parameter and should return either `True` or `False`. Returning `False` cancels event handler. Example implementation in `Page` class:
```
defbefore_event(self, e: ControlEvent):ifisinstance(e, RouteChangeEvent):if self.route == e.route:returnFalse      self.query()returnsuper().before_event(e)
```

#### `ft.context.page` works everywhere[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#ftcontextpage-works-everywhere "Direct link to ftcontextpage-works-everywhere")
It's now possible to get a reference to a current `Page` instance in any part of Flet program.
## The new Architecture[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#the-new-architecture "Direct link to The new Architecture")
Flet 1.0 is not just a feature release ‚Äî it's a ground-up rewrite designed to address technical debt, improve maintainability, and unlock long-term performance and flexibility. Here are some of the most impactful architectural changes:
### Simplified Python control implementation[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#simplified-python-control-implementation "Direct link to Simplified Python control implementation")
  * Controls are now implemented as Python **dataclasses** , bringing:
    * Automatic constructor generation
    * Native support for default values, type annotations, and field validation
    * No more manual conversions to/from `str` or `JSON`
    * Seamless support for **complex property types** (nested dataclasses, enums, etc.)
  * This significantly reduces boilerplate and makes adding new controls trivial ‚Äî often zero-maintenance.


### Strong typing and IDE support[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#strong-typing-and-ide-support "Direct link to Strong typing and IDE support")
  * Event handlers are now **strongly typed** , improving both runtime safety and developer ergonomics.
  * All controls include **docstrings** , enabling rich auto-generated API documentation with **Docusaurus**.


### Smarter UI diffing[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#smarter-ui-diffing "Direct link to Smarter UI diffing")
  * A new **diffing algorithm** powers efficient updates to the UI tree.
  * It‚Äôs optimized for both **imperative** and **declarative** Flet programming styles.
  * This results in faster rebuilds and fewer unnecessary redraws.


### Dart runtime modernization[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#dart-runtime-modernization "Direct link to Dart runtime modernization")
  * Replaced the old Redux-based state management with **InheritedWidget** + **Provider**.
  * The internal control hierarchy on the Dart side now mirrors the Python control tree, enabling **more efficient traversal and updates**.


### Binary protocol for performance[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#binary-protocol-for-performance "Direct link to Binary protocol for performance")
  * A new **binary serialization protocol** (MessagePack) replaces the JSON-based message format:
    * Significantly reduces traffic size
    * No more base64 encoding for transferring binary data (e.g., images, files)
  * Control property names in Dart now **exactly match their Python counterparts** , making it easier to debug and extend across both runtimes.


## Breaking changes[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#breaking-changes "Direct link to Breaking changes")
Flet 1.0 is a major release and includes breaking changes ‚Äî for good reason!
The Flet team maintains a list of known breaking changes in [this issue](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/issues/5238).
If you discover something else that‚Äôs broken or incorrect, please submit a new issue or discussion. Once confirmed, we‚Äôll update the list.
Below is a summary of the most significant and impactful breaking changes:
### Single-threaded async UI model[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#single-threaded-async-ui-model "Direct link to Single-threaded async UI model")
Flet 1.0 adopts a single-threaded async UI model, similar to JavaScript or Flutter. This design makes concurrency more predictable and better suited for the browser and mobile platforms.
  * Blocking calls like `time.sleep()` will freeze the UI. Instead of `time.sleep()` use `async def` event handlers and using `await asyncio.sleep()` for delays.
  * Switch to async APIs whenever possible.
  * For CPU-bound tasks, offload them to threads using `asyncio.to_thread(...)`.


üöß Example with CPU-bound method updating progress bar üöß
### Async control methods[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#async-control-methods "Direct link to Async control methods")
All controls' get- and set- methods are async now.
Methods that do not return any results have fire-and-forget sync wrappers.
üöß Documentation is in progress üöß
### `ft.run()` replaces `ft.app()`[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#ftrun-replaces-ftapp "Direct link to ftrun-replaces-ftapp")
`target` argument renamed to `main` and the rest of method arguments stays the same. A new `before_main` argument added (see above).
### `Page` split[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#page-split "Direct link to page-split")
`Page` split into `Page` and `PageView`.
To support Flet embedding with multi-views.
It's not a breaking-change per-se if you just continue to use `page` instance methods or properties.
üöß Documentation is in progress üöß
### Dialogs[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#dialogs "Direct link to Dialogs")
To display a dialog, banner, snack bar, drawer, or any similar popup control, use `page.show_dialog(dialog_control)` instead of `page.open()`.
To close the topmost popup, use `page.pop_dialog()`.
### Drawers[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#drawers "Direct link to Drawers")
`page.drawer` and `page.end_drawer` were removed.
note
We might re-introduce this in the future, to fix displaying of the top menu icon button as in this [example](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold/endDrawer.html).
Use `NavigationDrawer.position` property and then `page.show_dialog()` to display drawer instead of `page.drawer` and `page.end_drawer`.
### FilePicker[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#filepicker "Direct link to FilePicker")
FilePicker is now a service and must be added to `page.services` list to work.
API re-worked to provide async methods immediatly returning dialog results without using "result" event handlers.
```
files:list[FilePickerFile]=await file_picker.pick_files_async(allow_multiple=True)file_name:str=await file_picker.save_file_async()dir_name:str=await file_picker.get_directory_path_async()
```

Full examples:
  * [All dialogs](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/v1/python/controls/utility/file-picker/file-picker-all-modes.py)
  * [Upload](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/v1/python/controls/utility/file-picker/file-picker-upload-progress.py)


### Clipboard[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#clipboard "Direct link to Clipboard")
Instead of `page.set_clipboard()` use `page.clipboard.set_async()`.
Instead of `page.get_clipboard()` use `page.clipboard.get_async()`.
### Client storage[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#client-storage "Direct link to Client storage")
"Client storage" is now "Shared Preferences".
`page.client_storage` property renamed to `page.shared_preferences`.
### Scrollables[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#scrollables "Direct link to Scrollables")
In scrollable controls `on_scroll_interval` property renamed to `scroll_interval`.
### Buttons[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#buttons "Direct link to Buttons")
All buttons: no `text` property, use `content` instead.
### Charts[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#charts "Direct link to Charts")
Chart controls have been moved to a separate package [flet-charts](https://pypi.org/project/flet-charts/).
### Control ID is integer[‚Äã](https://flet.dev/blog/introducing-flet-1-0-alpha/#control-id-is-integer "Direct link to Control ID is integer")
`e.target` is a number now, not a string.
