The Flet 0.26.0 release is here, featuring a significant update to the extensibility approach!
In summary, a Flet extension is now a single Python package that bundles both Python and Flutter code. This package can be part of your Flet project or hosted in a public Git repository or PyPI.
Built-in Flet extensions, such as `Audio`, `Video`, and `Map`, have been moved to their own repositories. You‚Äôre welcome to fork these extensions to create your own or contribute to Flet! These extensions have been published to PyPI, making them easy to include in your Flet app. To use them, simply add the desired extensions to the `dependencies` section of your `pyproject.toml` file.
