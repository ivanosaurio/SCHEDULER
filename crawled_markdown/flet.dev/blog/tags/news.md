Flet has been in the making for over three years, steadily gaining traction and building a vibrant user community. As more developers adopt Flet for real-world projects, one thing has become clear: people are ready to commit ‚Äî but they also want to see the same commitment from us.
Releasing **Flet 1.0** isn‚Äôt just about a version number. It‚Äôs about signaling stability, maturity, and long-term vision. A stable API, comprehensive documentation, better testing and clearly communicated roadmap ‚Äî these are the foundational pieces developers need to confidently build serious apps on Flet.
But **Flet 1.0 isn‚Äôt just the next incremental release. It‚Äôs a complete re-architecture**.
The first versions of Flet inherited design decisions from Pglet ‚Äî a web-based framework with a focus on multi-language support. While that served as a useful starting point, Flet has since evolved into a Python-centric framework for building cross-platform apps ‚Äî web, desktop, and mobile.
With that evolution came technical debt, architectural misfits, and increasing complexity. Rather than patch over the cracks, we made a bold decision: to rewrite Flet from the ground up. It‚Äôs always risky to rewrite, but there‚Äôs no better time than now ‚Äî before 1.0 ‚Äî while the user base is still manageable and we can afford to break things in the name of long-term simplicity and maintainability.
After nearly five months of work, **today we‚Äôre releasing the Flet 1.0 Alpha ‚Äî a technical preview of what‚Äôs coming.**

When building mobile apps with Flet, you may need to interact directly with platform-specific APIs. Whether it‚Äôs accessing system information, managing Bluetooth devices, or working with user preferences, **Pyjnius** and **Pyobjus** by Kivy provide a seamless way to bridge Python with Java (for Android) and Objective-C (for iOS).
You can now integrate both Pyjnius and Pyobjus into your Flet apps! üöÄ

This post is a continuation of [Flet mobile strategy](https://flet.dev/blog/flet-mobile-strategy) published a few months ago.
Our original approach to Flet running on a mobile device was Server-Driven UI. Though SDUI has its own benefits (like bypassing App Store for app updates) it doesn't work in all cases, requires web server to host Python part of the app and, as a result, adds latency which is not great for user actions requiring nearly instance UI response, like drawing apps.
I've been thinking on how to make Python runtime embedded into Flutter iOS or Android app to run user Python program. No doubt, it's technically possible as Kivy and BeeWare projects do that already.

Flet is a fast-evolving framework with a new functionality and bug fixes being committed every other day.
The development model with one pull request per release didn't work well for the project as users waited for weeks to get hands on a new release and, honestly, from development perspective producing large "heroic" releases takes a lot of energy ü´†.
From now on we'll be breaking releases into multiple pull requests with one feature/bugfix per PR.
Every PR merged into `main` branch will be publishing pre-release (developmental release) package to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/flet/) having version format of `X.Y.Z.devN`.

Today we announce the first release of Flet!
Flet is a framework for building real-time web, desktop and mobile applications in Python.
No more complex architecture with JavaScript frontend, REST API backend, database, cache, etc. With Flet you just write a monolith stateful app in Python only and get multi-user, realtime Single-Page Application (SPA) or a mobile app.
To start developing with Flet, you just need your favorite IDE or text editor. No SDKs, no thousands of dependencies, no complex tooling - Flet has built-in web server with assets hosting and desktop clients.
Flet UI is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), so your app looks professional and can be delivered to any platform. Flet simplifies Flutter model by combining smaller "widgets" into ready-to-use "controls" with imperative programming model. You get all the power of Flutter without having to learn Dart!
Flet app is deployed as a regular web app and can be instanly accessed with a browser or installed as a [PWA](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) on a mobile device. Web app also exposes an API that can be used by a Flet client (planned for [future releases](https://flet.dev/roadmap)) running on iOS and Android and providing native mobile experience.
Some examples:

  * [Counter](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/counter/counter.py)
  * [To-Do](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/todo/todo.py)
  * [Icons Browser](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/icons-browser/main.py) ([Online Demo](https://gallery.flet.dev/icons-browser/))
