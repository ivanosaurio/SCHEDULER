# Flet at PyCon US 2024

Last week we attended PyCon US in a beautiful city of Pittsburgh, PA!
I've been on many conferences, but at PyCon I was amazed by the spacious venue, flawless event organization, high-quality content and welcoming community üòé, ...and good food üçî!
![](https://flet.dev/img/blog/pycon-us-2024/pycon-us-2024-collage.jpg)
We met a lot of great people and, especially, wonderful people from Beeware (hello Russell, Malcolm and Russell üëã). They did a great job of popularizing Python on mobile and advocating the addition of iOS and Android to the list of supported platforms in the next release of Python 3.13 üéâ!
We enjoyed good talks and inspirational key notes, learned new things, enjoyed the city. Lightning talks (short 5-minute presentations) were real fun!
Oh, I saw Guido van Rossum (The Creator of Python himself, in case you didn't know üòÖ) at Microsoft booth, but didn't have a chance to take a picture with him as there was a line up üòâ.
As first time attendees we did't do talks or presentations, but watched and learned instead. We plan to present next year ü§û.
Next PyCon US is going to be at the same place. Will come again and hope to see more of you there!
