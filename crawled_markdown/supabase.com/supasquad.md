## How to join[#](https://supabase.com/open-source/contributing/supasquad#how-to-join)
Apply to join the program using [this form](https://airtable.com/shr0FtLqLfhpuEya8).
## FAQs[#](https://supabase.com/open-source/contributing/supasquad#faqs)
_Why are you only admitting 20 new members?_
The entire Supabase team is only 20 people, so as you can imagine adding another 20 people sounds like a lot to us! We wish we could admit everyone who wanted to join. But we also want to make sure everyone who joins the Squad has an awesome experience. In the future we will probably expand the intake to include a monthly quota.
_What is expected?_
Mostly just enthusiasm. If you are interested in Open Source and want to get involved, the SupaSquad program is a great channel. You'll be given opportunities to contribute to the community in whatever ways match your skillset.
_What if I become too busy to contribute?_
No worries! The program isn't a job. It's just an opportunity to build your skillset and audience within the Supabase ecosystem.
